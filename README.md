# BMTK-Loihi Datasets
This dataset lists the different parameter sets and stimulus sets used in the validation of Loihi implementations of LIF models based on BMTK (Brain Modeling ToolKit) simulations, including :
- LIF model parameters for excitatory and inhibitory neurons based on the data from Allen Brain Atlas.
- External spike-train stimulus data generated using random Poisson process.
