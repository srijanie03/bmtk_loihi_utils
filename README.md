# BMTK-Loihi Datasets
This dataset lists the different parameter sets and stimulus sets used in the validation of Loihi implementations of LIF models based on BMTK (Brain Modeling ToolKit) simulations, including :
- LIF model parameters for excitatory and inhibitory neurons based on the data from Allen Brain Atlas (https://www.brain-map.org/).
- External spike-train stimulus data generated using random Poisson process.


## Data
- The parameter set data is in JSON format and is used directly into BMTK. It is converted into a python dictionary for use in Loihi.
- The spike-train data is in CSV format.
